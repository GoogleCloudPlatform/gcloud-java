### Overview

Most of the release process is handled by the `after_success.sh` script, triggered after Travis CI successfully completes a non-PR build.  A new artifact will be released to Maven Central Repository via Travis CI when "-SNAPSHOT" is not included in the version (as listed in the base directory's `pom.xml`).  The website and README files will also be updated automatically in this case.  When "-SNAPSHOT" is included in the version, Travis only updates the artifact in the snapshot repository.

### To push a release version

1. Run `utilities/update_pom_version.sh` from the repository's base directory.
This script takes an optional argument denoting the new version.  By default, if the current version is X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT, the script will update the version in all the pom.xml files to X.Y.Z.  If desired, another version can be supplied via command line argument instead.

2. Create a PR to update the pom.xml version.
The PR should look something like [#225](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-java/pull/225).  After this PR is merged into GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-java, Travis CI will push a new website to GoogleCloudPlatform/gh-pages, push a new artifact to the Maven Central Repository, and update versions in the README files.

3. Before moving on, verify that the artifacts have successfully been pushed to the Maven Central Repository.  Open Travis CI, click the ["Build History" tab](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-java/builds), and open the second build's logs for Step 2's PR.  Be sure that you are not opening the "Pull Request" build logs.  When the build finishes, scroll to the end of the log and verify that the artifacts were successfully staged and deployed.  You can also search for `gcloud-java` on the [Sonatype website](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~gcloud-java) and check the latest version number.  If the deployment didn't succeed because of a flaky test, rerun the build.

4. Create a release on Github manually.
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-java/releases) and click "Draft a new release."  Use `vX.Y.Z` as the "Tag Version" and `X.Y.Z` as the "Release Title", where `X.Y.Z` is the release version as listed in the `pom.xml` files.

5. Run `utilities/update_pom_version.sh` again (to include "-SNAPSHOT" in the project version).
As mentioned before, there is an optional version argument.  By default, the script will update the version from "X.Y.Z" to "X.Y.Z+1-SNAPSHOT".  Suppose a different version is desired, for example X+1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.  Then the appropriate command to run would be `utilities/update_pom_version.sh X+1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.

6. Create and merge in another PR to reflect the updated project version.  For an example of what this PR should look like, see [#227](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-java/pull/227).

### To push a snapshot version

Pushing a snapshot is completely automated.  If "-SNAPSHOT" is included in the version denoted by the base directory's pom.xml, then an updated artifact will be pushed to the snapshot repository when Travis CI successfully completes a non-PR build.

### Improvements

Automatic tagging is not currently implemented, though it was discussed in [#119](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-java/pull/119).  If the version updates continue to be manual, a one-line git tag command can be added to `after_success.sh` to correctly tag releases.  However, automatically creating useful annotations for this tag will be difficult.  Also, if the release process becomes fully automated, tagging becomes a harder problem, as mentioned in that issue.
