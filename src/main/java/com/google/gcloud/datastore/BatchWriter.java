 * <pre> {@code
 *   Entity entity1 = datastore.get(key1);
 *   BatchWriter batchWriter = datastore.newBatchWriter();
 *   Entity entity2 = Entity.builder(key2).set("name", "John").build();
 *   entity1 = Entity.builder(entity1).clear().setNull("bla").build();
 *   Entity entity3 = Entity.builder(key3).set("title", new StringValue("title")).build();
 *   batchWriter.update(entity1);
 *   batchWriter.add(entity2, entity3);
 *   batchWriter.submit();
 * } </pre>
