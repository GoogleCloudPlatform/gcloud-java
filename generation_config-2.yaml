    least privilege and helps mitigate risks tied to privileged access misuse orabuse.
    PAM allows you to shift from always-on standing privileges towards on-demand access
    with just-in-time, time-bound, and approval-based access elevations. PAM allows
    IAM administrators to create entitlements that can grant just-in-time, temporary
    access to any resource scope. Requesters can explore eligible entitlements and
    request the access needed for their task. Approvers are notified when approvals
    await their decision. Streamlined workflows facilitated by using PAM can support
    various use cases, including emergency access for incident responders, time-boxed
    access for developers for critical deployment or maintenance, temporary access
    for operators for data ingestion and audits, JIT access to service accounts for
    automated tasks, and more.
