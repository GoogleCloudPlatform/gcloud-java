Here are some guidelines for hacking on gcloud-java.


Using maven for build/test
--------------------------
After you cloned the repository use Maven for building and running the tests.
Maven 3.0+ is required.

When downloading the source, we recommend you obtain service account credentials. 
These credentials will allow you to run integration tests using `mvn verify` in command line. 
Follow step 2 of the [authentication instructions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-java#authentication) to generate and use JSON service account credentials.

It's also important to test that changes don't break compatibility with App/Compute Engine and when running elsewhere. 
To run tests on different platforms, try deploying the apps available on the [gcloud-java-examples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-java-examples) repository. 
End-to-end tests should ensure that gcloud-java works when running on the

* App Engine production environment (see the docs for [uploading your app to production App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/maven#uploading_your_app_to_production_app_engine))
* App Engine development server (see the docs for [testing your app with the development server](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/maven#testing_your_app_with_the_development_server))
* Compute Engine (see the [Getting Started Guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart), and be sure to [enable the appropriate APIs](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-common/tree/master/authentication#on-google-compute-engine))
* Your desktop (using `mvn exec:java`, for example)

When changes are made to authentication and project ID-related code, authentication and project ID inference should be tested using all relevant methods detailed in the [authentication docs](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-java#authentication) and [project ID docs](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-java#specifying-a-project-id).

Known issue: If you have installed the Google Cloud SDK, be sure to log in (using `gcloud auth login`) before running tests. Though the Datastore tests use a local Datastore emulator that doesn't require authentication, they will not run if you have the Google Cloud SDK installed but aren't authenticated.

Adding Features
---------------
In order to add a feature to gcloud-java:

The feature must be fully documented using Javadoc and examples should be provided.
The feature must work fully on Java 7 and above.
The feature must not add unnecessary dependencies (where "unnecessary" is of course subjective,
but new dependencies should be discussed).


Coding Style
------------
Maintain the coding style in the project and in particular the modified files.
Follow the Google Java [style](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html).
